        <p>This website is a fan-page about the show "The Bear". It's a show about a young chef, named Carmen Berzatto, from the fine dining world who comes home to Chicago to run his family sandwich shop after a heartbreaking death in his family. As Carmy fights to transform both the shop and himself, he works alongside a rough-around-the-edges kitchen crew that ultimately reveals itself as his chosen family.</p>
